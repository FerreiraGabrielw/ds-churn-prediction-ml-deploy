## About the Project  

This Data Science project focuses on predicting customer churn in a fictional telecommunications company. The dataset contains information from 7,043 customers in California during the third quarter, including demographics, services used, account information, billing, and whether the customer canceled their contract.  

The main objective is twofold:  
1. Predict churn (binary classification) using Machine Learning models.  
2. Interpret churn drivers to identify the main reasons behind customer attrition, enabling the company to develop proactive retention strategies.

## Technologies and Process  

* Tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Quarto, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit.  
* End-to-End Analysis Pipeline (E2E):  
    * Data Cleaning & Preparation:    
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
    * Feature Engineering & Encoding:  
    * Class Imbalance Handling:  
    * Modeling & Evaluation:  
    * Hyperparameter Optimization:  

* Key Insights (Business Perspective):  
    * High churn risk is associated with:  
        - Short tenure (customers within the first year).  
        - Month-to-month contracts.  
        - Electronic check payments.  
        - Lack of value-added services (tech support, online security).  
    * Strategic Recommendations:  
        - Strengthen onboarding in the first 6‚Äì9 months.  
        - Incentivize longer-term contracts with benefits/discounts.  
        - Address billing dissatisfaction (especially among high-paying customers).  
        - Bundle services to increase stickiness.
